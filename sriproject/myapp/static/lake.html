    Nanmangalam Lake is a small but significant water body located near Chrompet in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
    It plays a crucial role in recharging groundwater and supporting the local ecosystem.
    The lake is surrounded by residential areas and faces pressure due to rapid urbanization.
    Despite this, it continues to be a vital source of water during dry seasons.
    Nanmangalam Lake is also close to the Nanmangalam Reserve Forest, which adds to the area's ecological importance.
    In recent years, local communities and environmental groups have taken steps to protect and restore the lake.
    Rainwater collected in the lake helps improve the water table.
